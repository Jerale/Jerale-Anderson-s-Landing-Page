       Yo, my name is Jerale and this is a web page all about me! To start off, my full name is Jerale William Anderson and I am currently an Amazon FC Associate. I've been employed at Amazon for almost 2 years now. Although I have enjoyed most of my time there, I feel as though it is time for me to expand my knowledge with Software Development!
